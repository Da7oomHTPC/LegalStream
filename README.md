<h1>LegalStream</h1>
An m3u8 playlist featuring many LEGALLY FREE IPTV streams. For use with VLC.

I now have packages, allowing you to mix and match channel genres, allowing you to have only the channels YOU want in your lineup.

Example: https://github.com/notanewbie/My-Legalstream

<h2>NEW!</h2>
I'm currently working on updating the playlists by adding more tags, making the experience better for users of Roku channels like M3U Playlist Player or the M3U Black Player.

Also, see channel listings, package URLs and live demos at http://legalstream.notanewbie.com/test. Disclaimer: the video player's ability to play the streams may or may not match the actual availability of the channels.
